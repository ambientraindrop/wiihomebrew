Ever wanted to hack your Wii? Well, that's awesome. Ever wondered... how? Well, that's okay. I'll help you along the way and make sure it's done right.


Let's get started with the basics.

**Have a Wii Mini?** I'll cover that later. Also, please don't do this inside your [vWii](https://wiibrew.org/wiki/VWii).

# Step 1: Preparation (Wii)

You will need:

An SD card; at least 128 MB in size, no more than 32 GB in size. I would recommend a 4 GB SD card. I wouldn't recommend using microSD card adapters.
A Wii; on System Menu 4.3 or later.
Your Wii's MAC address; this can be found by going into `Wii Settings` -> `Internet` -> `Console Information`
